# Frontend (React + Vite)

This folder contains the React frontend for the Temporal Graph Visualizer. It was initialized with Vite and uses React.

Quick commands (run in PowerShell from this folder):

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\MAHENDRA KUMAR GUPTA\Desktop\DSA project\frontend"
npm install    # install dependencies (already done)
npm run dev    # start Vite dev server at http://localhost:5173
npm run build  # build production assets
```

Notes:

- The main React component is `src/App.jsx` (moved from your original `index.jsx`).
- If you want Tailwind CSS to work, add Tailwind configuration and CSS; currently the UI uses Tailwind classes but Tailwind isn't configured by default.
